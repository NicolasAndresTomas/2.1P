Overview
The goal of this project was to understand the basics of creating web servers with Node.js and Express. This involved setting up a Node.js environment, creating a simple web server, and serving a static HTML file.

Code Explanation
server.js: The main server file that uses Express to create a web server. It defines a route for the root URL (/) and serves the index.html file when this route is accessed.
index.html: A simple HTML file that contains the markup for the web page served by the server.
